  ## Things-learned
  
  This project taught me that I have ALOT to learn. I had a few struggles with setting up routes, making the auth work after signing in, in all honesty just getting the log-in functionality to work in the first place, partials in handlebars, passing infomation to handlebars, launching to heroku and everything breaking just to realize that nothing was acutally broken and there just wasn't any information on the database yet!  I look forward to re-trying the project when I have some more time and continuing to gain a better understanding of all these topics.
